Here is the first draft of my article, "Recursive Traversal Of An FTP 
Site With Net::FTP".

The article itself is called article.txt.

The source code that accompanies the article is contained in the 
.tar.gz file.  I can set up a web page so that the readers of
the article can download the source.


I have some free time to do as many revisions as you'd like, 
especially over the coming weekend (the 15th thru the 17th).
